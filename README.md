#  TARS Chrome Extension - cool page ui when you open that new tab

## Overview

This Chrome extension serves as a custom new tab dashboard UI,
offerings include
wallpaper (fetching images from Unsplash) ,
displays the current weather and time,
and provides the latest cryptocurrency data.
It is currently under development.

## What I learnt

This project was built using the following technologies and concepts :

- **Fetch API:** Used to fetch images from an external source, weather data, and cryptocurrency data.

- **HTTP Codes:** Handling different HTTP responses such as 200 OK, and error responses.

- **Promises:** Utilized `.then` and `.catch` to manage asynchronous operations.

- **Error Handling:** Used `throw` to handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

- **Async/Await:** Employed for managing asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way.

- **Official Documentation:** How to read and use official documentation is an at itlesf got accustomed to it dusring project

## Getting Started

To use this extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. Enable Developer Mode.

4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

5. The extension is now installed and ready to use. Each time you open a new tab, it will display the dynamic background image, weather, time, and cryptocurrency data.

## To-Do List For myself

The extension is still in development, things planned for the future:

- Adding Quotes to the UI ,I will try to make it configurable so that user can add their own quotes

- Adding a todo list for user , user can create,add ,update,delete

- Wishing the user by their name

- can show x % of day/month/year is remaing now

- can show x % of life is remaing now
